# what-am-i-having
This project was designed to assist users that have a hard time choosing what to eat/drink for dinner. Utilizing this web application will provide users a randomized meal and cocktail after using androp down selection menu to find a meal closer to their preference. 

The response of the app after use will provide an image of the final meal based on the user's selections and will return a list of the necessary ingredients as well as the instructions(recipe) to properly cook the randomly selected meal.
